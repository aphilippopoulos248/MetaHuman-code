# Bob the Discord Bot
This is the repository of the code I used for creating my AI for MetaHuman in Unreal Engine 5.6. I used a combination of ChatGPT and ElevenLabs to make it all possible. MetaHuman is a plugin added to Unreal Engine that allows you to create realistic looking humans for your project. I decided to play around with MetaHuman and use AI tools to give the MetaHuman artificial intelligence. I created this particular MetaHuman named Bob. His favorite hobby is eating pie. In this demo, I am demonstrating how you can communicate with Bob by typing in whatever you wish to say to him.
